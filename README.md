So Many Doors is a retro puzzle platformer inspired by the Game Boy look & feel.

Try to find your way through the levels, moving from door to door. Choose wisely and most important, don't die! If you can!

Demo contains first 4 levels! (MacOSX & WebGL)

Please note that this game is still in development, it is not a finished product, so don't expect everything to work perfectly :-)
