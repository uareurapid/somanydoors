So Many Doors is a retro puzzle platformer inspired by the Game Boy look & feel.

Try to find your way through the doors maze, moving from door to door. Choose wisely, be fast, and most important, don't die! If you can!

Demo contains first 9 levels!

Please note that this game is still in development, it is not a finished product, so don't expect everything to work perfectly :-)
